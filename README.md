# Leaf Counting

This project explores a traditional computer vision approach for estimating the number of leaves in an image. The pipeline uses a combination of edge detection, Harris corner detection, gradient-based filtering, and DBSCAN clustering to identify leaf tips and count them.

The entire method is implemented in Python using OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-learn. It works best on images where leaf tips are relatively clear and easy to distinguish from the background.
